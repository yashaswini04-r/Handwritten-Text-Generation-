# Handwritten-Text-Generation-
Handwritten text generation creates synthetic handwriting images mimicking human writing styles using AI techniques like GANs, diffusion models, and transformers. These models capture style and content from few samples to generate realistic, varied handwritten text.

Installation steps:
Install the library using pip install pywhatkit
Run this script; it generates an image file "handwritten.png" with the text in a handwriting style.
This method requires minimal code and is suitable for simple, quick handwritten text generation.

Usage Guidelines:
Import PyWhatKit in Python: import pywhatkit as kit
Use kit.text_to_handwriting("Your text here", "output.png") to generate handwriting image
Customize handwriting color with an optional RGB parameter
